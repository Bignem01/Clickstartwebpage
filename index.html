	<h2> <b> My I.T Experience</b></h2>
<p> My first memory of computers starts at the age of around 5 or 6.</p>
<p> After spending a number of years console gaming on various systems. I then started using a computer again at age 11 to explore funny junk and play flash games. It was also then that I started to explore and watch content on youtube before making an account in March of 2010 so that i could keep a watch history and subscribe to creators whos content i enjoyed and wished to support.</p>
<p> My I.T knowldge then progressed when studying photography at GCSE where i was introduced to the basics and fundamentals of photoshop. This then progressed onto a level 3 diploma level of studies at bath college. </p>
<p>I have used Computers and computer systems my whole life but have never researched and explored how computers run and the code that powers them.</p>

	<h2><b>Why am I doing this course?</b></h2>
<p>I started this course after dropping out of university and spending almost 5 years in a dissatisfying retail job. I spent the summer happily unemployed before finding freelance work for an events company where i work as an event technition. The opportunity of the course fell into my lap not long after when a friend who works for Bath Spa mentioned that there were spaces on the upcoming cohort.
